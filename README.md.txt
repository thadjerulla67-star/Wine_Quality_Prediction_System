Student Performance Prediction System
A classroom machine-learning prototype built with Python, scikit-learn, GitHub, and Streamlit.
Project purpose
The system explores whether historical student information can help flag learners who may need additional academic support.
Dataset
UCI Machine Learning Repository — Student Performance: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance
The project retrieves the dataset using ucimlrepo (dataset ID 320).
Prediction target
* G3 < 10 = AT RISK
* G3 >= 10 = NOT AT RISK
Important: G3 is the target only. It is removed from the input features to prevent target leakage.
Technologies
* Python
* pandas
* scikit-learn (Random Forest classifier)
* Streamlit
* ucimlrepo
* joblib
Project files
* train_model.py — downloads the dataset, preprocesses data, trains/evaluates the model, and saves the model.
* app.py — Streamlit dashboard, CSV upload, predictions, and result download.
* requirements.txt — required Python packages.
Run locally
1. Install Python 3.10 or later.
2. Open a terminal in this project folder.
3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Train the model and download the dataset:
python train_model.py
5. Start the Streamlit application:
streamlit run app.py
6. Open the local URL shown in the terminal (normally http://localhost:8501).
7. Download the sample input CSV from the app, then upload it to test predictions.
If student_model.pkl or student_data.csv is missing, the app attempts to create them automatically. An internet connection is required for the initial dataset download.
GitHub upload
Create a public repository named student-performance-prediction, then upload:
* app.py
* train_model.py
* requirements.txt
* README.md
The generated dataset and model files are not required in the repository because the app can generate them when first run. Do not upload passwords, access tokens, or other secrets.
Limitations and responsible use
This is a classroom demonstration using public historical data. A model trained on one dataset may not generalize to another institution or population. Predictions are not diagnoses and must not be used as the sole basis for real student decisions.
